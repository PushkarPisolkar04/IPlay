## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
node --version  # v18.x or higher
npm --version   # v8.x or higher
flutter --version  # v3.0 or higher
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/iplay.git
cd iplay
```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Set up Firebase Configuration** ⚠️ REQUIRED

   The following files are excluded from version control for security:
   - `android/app/google-services.json`
   - `lib/firebase_options.dart`
   - `android/local.properties`
   
   **To set up Firebase:**
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
   - Create Firestore database (follow `firestore.rules` for security)
   - Download `google-services.json` to `android/app/`
   - Run `flutterfire configure` to generate `firebase_options.dart`
   - Update `android/local.properties` with your local Android SDK path
   
   **Note:** Firebase Storage is NOT needed - all content is local!

4. **Install Cloud Functions dependencies** (optional)
```bash
cd functions
npm install
cd ..
```

5. **Run the app**
```bash
flutter run
```

### First-Time Setup

**Populate badges database** (run once):
```dart
import 'package:iplay/core/utils/populate_badges.dart';

// In a temporary admin screen:
final populator = BadgePopulator();
await populator.populateBadges();
await populator.verifyBadges();
```

---

## 🔥 Firebase Deployment

### Deploy Firestore rules and indexes
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

**Note:** No Cloud Functions or Storage to deploy. All logic runs in-app.

---

## 📊 Database Schema

| Collection | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `/users` | User profiles, XP, badges | Authentication & progress tracking |
| `/schools` | School entities | Principal management |
| `/classrooms` | Classroom groups | Teacher-student hierarchy |
| `/announcements` | Class announcements | Teacher communication |
| `/progress` | Learning progress | Level completion tracking |
| `/join_requests` | Classroom requests | Approval workflow |
| `/assignments` | Teacher assignments | Homework system |
| `/assignment_submissions` | Student work | Submission + grading |
| `/certificates` | Achievements | PDF certificates |
| `/daily_challenge_attempts` | Challenge results | One per user/day |
| `/reports` | Content moderation | Report system |
| `/feedback` | User feedback | Feature requests |
| `/leaderboard_cache` | Rankings | Daily aggregated |
| `/badges` | Badge unlocks | User badge tracking |
| `/game_progress` | Game statistics | High scores, attempts, time spent |

### Local JSON Content (NOT in Firebase)

- **Daily Challenge Generation** - Runs in-app at midnight
  - Creates daily 5-question challenge
  - 50 XP reward
  - Random selection from question bank

## 🔒 Security

### Firestore Rules

- Users can only access their own data
- Teachers manage their classrooms
- Principals manage their schools
- Cloud Functions have admin access

### Authentication
- Email verification required
- Password reset enabled
- Google Sign-In configured
- No password storage in app

### Content Security
- All educational content bundled locally (no CMS)
- No Firebase Storage needed (free tier friendly)

## 📈 Free Tier Sustainability

### Firebase Limits (Spark Plan - FREE)
✅ **Firestore**: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day, 1 GB storage

✅ **No Functions**: All logic in-app (no invocation costs)
✅ **No Storage**: All content local (no storage/bandwidth costs)

### Estimated Usage (100 students)
- Reads: ~5K/day (10% of limit) - Only user data, not content
- Writes: ~2K/day (10% of limit) - Progress tracking only
- Storage: ~50 MB (5% of limit) - User data only
- **Conclusion**: Free tier sufficient for 1000+ students

### Why This Architecture is Cost-Effective
- ❌ No Cloud Functions costs (all logic in-app)
- ❌ No Firebase Storage costs (content is local)
- ❌ No bandwidth charges (assets bundled)
- ❌ No server costs (no backend)
