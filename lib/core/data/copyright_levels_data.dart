# What is Copyright?

Copyright is a **legal right** that grants the creator of original work exclusive rights to its use and distribution. It is a form of intellectual property protection designed to protect creative works.

## Why Copyright Matters

Copyright protection encourages creativity and innovation by ensuring creators can:
- Control how their work is used
- Earn income from their creations
- Prevent unauthorized copying or distribution
- Maintain the integrity of their work

## What Copyright Protects

Copyright protects original works of authorship including:
- **Literary works**: Books, articles, poems, computer programs
- **Artistic works**: Paintings, photographs, sculptures
- **Musical works**: Songs, compositions, lyrics
- **Dramatic works**: Plays, scripts, choreography
- **Cinematographic films**: Movies, documentaries
- **Sound recordings**: Albums, podcasts, audio files

## What Copyright Does NOT Protect

‚ùå Ideas, concepts, or facts
‚ùå Titles, names, or short phrases
‚ùå Methods or systems
‚ùå Government documents
‚ùå Works in the public domain

## Automatic Protection

In India, copyright protection is **automatic** upon creation. You don't need to register to have copyright protection, though registration provides additional legal benefits.
