- Not easily discoverable

**2. Economic Value:**
- Provides competitive edge
- Value derived from secrecy

**3. Reasonable Protection:**
- Owner takes steps to maintain secrecy
- NDAs, access controls, etc.

## Famous Examples

**Global:**
- Coca-Cola formula (120+ years secret)
- KFC's 11 herbs & spices recipe
- Google search algorithm
- WD-40 formula

**Indian:**
- MDH spice blends
- Dabur Chyawanprash formula
- Haldiram's snack recipes

## Types of Trade Secrets

**1. Technical:**

## Trade Secret vs. Patent

| Feature | Trade Secret | Patent |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| Protection | Secrecy | Registration |
| Duration | Unlimited (if secret) | 20 years |
| Disclosure | None | Full disclosure |
| Cost | Low | High (filing, maintenance) |
| Reverse Engineering | Permitted | Infringement |

## Indian Legal Framework

**No specific Trade Secrets Act in India**

**Protection through:**
- Contract Law (NDAs, employment contracts)
- Common Law (breach of confidence)
- Information Technology Act, 2000
- Copyright Act (for software)

**Remedy:** Civil suit for breach of confidence

# Restrictive Covenants in India

## Non-Compete Agreements

**Definition:**
Clause preventing employee from joining competitor or starting competing business for a period after leaving.

**Indian Law:**

**Section 27, Indian Contract Act:**

### Exceptions (Valid Non-Competes):

**1. Sale of Goodwill (Section 27 exception):**
- Seller of business can agree not to compete
- Must be reasonable in time, geography, scope

**Example:**
- X sells restaurant to Y
- X agrees not to open similar restaurant in same city for 3 years
- Valid âœ“

**2. Partnership Agreements:**
- Partners can agree not to compete during partnership
- After partnership, generally void

**3. During Employment:**
- Employee cannot work for competitor simultaneously
- Conflict of interest

### Landmark Cases

**Niranjan Shankar Golikari vs. Century Spinning (1967)**

**Facts:**
- Managing agent terminated

- Struck down as void
- Employee's right to livelihood paramount

## Non-Solicitation Agreements

**Definition:**
Prevents ex-employee from:
- Soliciting clients
- Poaching employees

**Indian Law:**

**More Lenient than Non-Compete:**
- Not directly covered by Section 27
- Courts may uphold if reasonable

**Conditions for Validity:**

âœ“ **Limited Duration:** 6 months - 1 year
âœ“ **Limited Scope:** Specific clients only
âœ“ **Reasonable Geography:** Not entire country
âœ“ **Protects Legitimate Interest:** Client relationships built using employer resources

### Case Law

**Wipro vs. Beckman Coulter (2006)**

**Facts:**
- Employee poached Wipro clients after joining competitor

**Court:**
- Granted injunction
- Unfair solicitation of clients

**Reasoning:**
Client relationships were confidential info

**SanDisk vs. Aseem Jain (2017)**

**Court:**
- Injunction granted for 6 months
- Non-solicit upheld as protecting trade secrets (client lists)

## Garden Leave

**Definition:**
Employee serves notice period but doesn't work; stays "in the garden."

**Purpose:**
- Prevent immediate competition
- Allow memory to fade
- Client transition time

**Validity in India:**
- If employee is paid: Generally valid
- If unpaid: May be challenged

**Typical Duration:** 3-6 months

## Strategies for Employers

**Since Non-Compete is Void:**

**1. Strong Confidentiality Clauses:**
- Protect trade secrets
- Enforceable unlike non-compete

**2. Non-Solicitation (Reasonable):**
- Limited duration
- Specific clients/employees

**3. Garden Leave:**
- Pay during notice period
- Keep employee idle

**4. Deferred Compensation:**
- Bonuses paid post-employment
- Forfeited if joining competitor (gray area)

**5. Specialized Training Bonds:**
- Employee pays if leaves early after costly training
- Must be reasonable

## Employee Rights

**Constitutional Protection:**

**Article 19(1)(g):**
Right to practice any profession, trade, or business

**Article 21:**
Right to livelihood

**Courts Balance:**
- Employer's legitimate interest
- vs. Employee's right to livelihood

**Generally:** Employee rights prevail

## Comparison: India vs. Global

| Country | Non-Compete Validity |
|---------|---------------------|
| India | Void (Section 27) |
| USA | Valid if reasonable (state-dependent) |
| UK | Valid if reasonable |
| California (USA) | Void (like India) |

## Practical Tips

**For Employers:**
- Don't waste time on non-compete
- Focus on confidentiality + non-solicit
- Build retention through culture, not clauses

**For Employees:**
- Non-compete in India is unenforceable
- But honor confidentiality obligations
- Avoid client poaching (legal risk)
- Consult lawyer if threatened

# Trade Secrets for Startups & Business

## Why Trade Secrets for Startups?

**Advantages:**

âœ“ **No Cost:** Unlike patents (â‚¹50,000-5 lakhs)
âœ“ **Immediate:** Protection starts now
âœ“ **No Disclosure:** Competitors don't learn
âœ“ **Unlimited Duration:** If maintained
âœ“ **Flexibility:** Can patent later if needed

**Ideal For:**
- Early-stage startups
- Bootstrapped companies
- Software/SaaS
- Algorithms, processes
- Customer databases

## Startup Protection Strategy

### Phase 1: Founding (Day 1)

**Founders' Agreement:**
- IP ownership clauses
- All IP belongs to company
- Confidentiality obligations

**Incorporation:**
- IP assignment from founders to company
- Document all pre-existing IP

### Phase 2: Early Employees (Month 1-6)

**Employment Contracts Must Have:**

1. **Confidentiality Clause**
2. **IP Assignment** (work product belongs to company)
3. **No Solicitation** (reasonable)
4. **Return of Materials** on exit

**Example Clause:**
"All inventions, discoveries, and work product created during employment shall be the sole property of the Company."

### Phase 3: Fundraising (Seed/Series A)

**Investors Will Ask:**

- What IP do you own?
- Is it properly protected?
- Any employee disputes?
- Third-party claims?

**Due Diligence Prep:**

âœ“ All employees signed IP agreements
âœ“ Contractors have assignment clauses
âœ“ No pending disputes
âœ“ Trade secret policy documented

### Phase 4: Growth (Scaling)

**Expanded Measures:**

- Formal classification system
- Access control matrices
- Security audits
- Background checks
- Legal counsel on retainer

## Licensing Trade Secrets

**Can You License a Secret?**

**Yes, but carefully:**

**License vs. Disclosure:**
- Disclose secret to licensee
- But maintain confidentiality
- Licensee can use but not re-disclose

**License Agreement Must Include:**

1. **Definition** of trade secret being licensed
2. **Scope** of permitted use
3. **Duration** of license
4. **Confidentiality** obligations
5. **Royalty** terms
6. **Return/Destruction** on termination
7. **No Sub-Licensing** (usually)

**Example:**

**Coca-Cola Bottling:**
- Coca-Cola licenses syrup formula to bottlers
- Bottlers sign strict confidentiality
- No disclosure, no reverse engineering
- Decades-long relationships

### Types of Licenses

**1. Exclusive:**
- One licensee only
- Licensor can't use or license to others

**2. Non-Exclusive:**
- Multiple licensees
- Licensor retains rights

**3. Sole:**
- One licensee + licensor can use
- No other licensees

## Joint Ventures & Collaborations

**Challenges:**

- Sharing secrets with partner
- Risk of misuse
- IP ownership disputes

**Protections:**

**1. Clear JV Agreement:**
- What's shared, what's not
- Ownership of new IP created
- Confidentiality obligations
- Exit provisions

**2. Background vs. Foreground IP:**
- Background: Pre-existing IP (each keeps)
- Foreground: Created in JV (shared or assigned)

**3. Disclosure Limitations:**
- Share only what's necessary
- Redact sensitive parts
- Staged disclosure

**Example:**

**Tata-Fiat JV:**
- Tata shared manufacturing processes
- Fiat shared engine tech
- Clear agreements on IP ownership
- JV ended, IP returned/separated

## Trade Secrets in M&A

**Acquisition Scenario:**

**Buyer's Concerns:**
- Is target's IP properly protected?
- Any employee theft risks?
- Litigation pending?

**Seller's Concerns:**
- Protect secrets during due diligence
- Prevent buyer from backing out and using info

**Solutions:**

**1. Tiered Disclosure:**
- High-level info first
- Detailed info after LOI signed
- Most sensitive info post-closing only

**2. Clean Room:**
- Neutral party reviews sensitive info
- Provides summary to buyer
- Full access only after deal closes

**3. Escrow:**
- Detailed trade secrets in escrow
- Released only on closing
- Returned if deal fails

## Open Source & Trade Secrets

**Conflict:**

- Open source requires code disclosure
- Trade secret requires secrecy

**Can't Have Both for Same Code**

**Strategies:**

**1. Dual Licensing:**
- Open source version (basic)
- Proprietary version (advanced features secret)
- Example: MySQL

**2. Open Core:**
- Core product open source
- Premium features/plugins closed
- Example: GitLab

**3. SaaS Model:**
