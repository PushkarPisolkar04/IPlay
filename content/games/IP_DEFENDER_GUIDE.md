# IP Defender - Tower Defense Game Guide

## Overview

IP Defender is a tower defense game where players protect intellectual property assets from waves of infringers. Players strategically place towers along enemy paths to prevent threats from reaching the IP assets at the center.

## Game Mechanics

### Objective
Defend your IP assets from infringement threats by building and upgrading towers. Survive all waves in a level to win.

### Resources
- **IP Coins**: Currency used to build and upgrade towers
- **Starting Coins**: Each level provides initial coins (500-1000)
- **Wave Rewards**: Earn coins by defeating enemies and completing waves
- **Income Towers**: Trade Secret Vaults generate passive income

### IP Asset Health
- Each level has an IP asset with health points (100-200)
- Enemies that reach the end of the path damage the IP asset
- Game over if IP asset health reaches zero
- Protect your IP at all costs!

## Strategy Tips

### Early Game (Levels 1-3)
1. Build 2-3 Copyright Shields at path curves
2. Save coins for Patent Cannon when Infringers appear
3. Don't over-invest in upgrades early
4. Focus on coverage over power

### Mid Game (Levels 4-6)
1. Add Trademark Barriers at path entrance
2. Build at least one Trade Secret Vault for income
3. Start upgrading key towers to level 2
4. Balance offense and economy

### Late Game (Levels 7-10)
1. Upgrade Patent Cannons to level 3 for Infringers
2. Multiple Trademark Barriers for crowd control
3. Maximize Trade Secret Vault income
4. Strategic tower placement is crucial

### Tower Placement Tips
- **Corners**: Best for maximum path coverage
- **Chokepoints**: Ideal for high-damage towers
- **Path Entrance**: Place slow towers here
- **Center Coverage**: Ensure no gaps in defense

### Economy Management
- Build Trade Secret Vaults early (Level 3-4)
- Don't spend all coins immediately
- Save for emergency tower placement
- Upgrade existing towers vs building new ones

### Wave Management
- Check wave composition before it starts
- Prepare for enemy type (fast vs armored)
- Use slow towers before damage towers
- Focus fire on dangerous enemies first

## Educational Content

### IP Protection Concepts
- **Copyright Shield**: Protects creative works (books, music, art)
- **Patent Cannon**: Defends inventions and innovations
- **Trademark Barrier**: Guards brand identity and logos
- **Trade Secret Vault**: Secures confidential business information

### Infringement Types
- **Counterfeiter**: Creates fake products with stolen trademarks
- **Pirate**: Illegally copies and distributes copyrighted content
- **Infringer**: Violates patent rights by making/selling patented inventions
- **Copycat**: Steals designs and trade dress without permission

### Real-World Parallels
- Tower placement = Strategic IP portfolio management
- Resource management = Budget allocation for IP protection
- Wave defense = Responding to infringement threats
- Upgrades = Strengthening IP rights through registration and enforcement

## Technical Details

### Path Coordinates
Each level has a defined path using grid coordinates (x, y):
- Grid size: 10x10 tiles
- Enemies follow path from start (0, y) to end (10, y)
- Paths include turns and curves for strategic placement

### Spawn Intervals
- Wave spawn intervals: 400ms to 3000ms
- Faster intervals = more challenging
- Plan tower placement during gaps

### Damage Calculation
- Base damage × tower level multiplier
- Area towers hit multiple enemies
- Slow effects stack with damage

### Victory Conditions
- Survive all waves in a level
- IP asset health > 0
- Earn XP and coin rewards

### Defeat Conditions
- IP asset health reaches 0
- Can retry level with same starting conditions

## Asset Information

### Sprites
- **Towers**: 64x64 pixels, located in `assets/towers/`
- **Enemies**: 32x32 (standard) or 40x40 (Infringer), located in `assets/enemies/`
