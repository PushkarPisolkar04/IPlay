  "content": "## Core Criteria (Novelty & Originality)\n\nTo register a design in India, it must meet two critical requirements: **Novelty** and **Originality**.\n\n### Requirement 1: Novelty (New)\n\n**Definition:** The design must be **new** - not previously published or used anywhere in the world.\n\n**The Test:**\n- Has this exact design been published before?\n- Has it been used in India before?\n- Has it been disclosed to the public?\n\n**What Destroys Novelty:**\n\n**1. Prior Publication:**\n- Published in any document anywhere in the world\n- Shown in a catalog, magazine, website\n- Displayed at a trade show\n\n**2. Prior Use in India:**\n- Already being sold in India\n- Already being manufactured in India\n\n**3. Your Own Disclosure:**\n- If YOU publish your design before filing, you lose novelty\n- Exception: 6-month grace period in India (we'll cover this)\n\n**Example:**\n- ❌ You design a chair, post photos on Instagram, then try to register → Novelty lost\n- ✅ You design a chair, file for registration, then post on Instagram → Novelty preserved\n\n### The 6-Month Grace Period\n\n**Indian Law Advantage:**\nUnder Section 6 of the Designs Act, you have a **6-month grace period** from first disclosure to file your application.\n\n**How it Works:**\n- Day 0: You display your design at a trade show\n- Day 1-180: Grace period (novelty not lost)\n- Day 180: Last day to file application\n- Day 181+: Novelty lost, can't register\n\n**Important:** This grace period is ONLY in India. In many countries (like EU), any public disclosure before filing destroys novelty immediately.\n\n### Requirement 2: Originality (Not Obvious)\n\n**Definition:** The design must be **original** - not an obvious variation of existing designs.\n\n**The Test:**\n- Would a person skilled in the art consider this design obvious?\n- Is it just a minor, trivial change to an existing design?\n- Does it have a distinct visual character?\n\n**What is NOT Original:**\n\n**1. Obvious Variations:**\n- Changing color only (red chair → blue chair)\n- Changing size only (small phone → large phone)\n- Trivial modifications (adding one more button)\n\n**2. Combination of Known Features:**\n- Taking two existing designs and combining them\n- Unless the combination creates a new visual character\n\n**3. Common Design Elements:**\n- Using standard industry shapes\n- Using generic patterns\n\n**Example:**\n- ❌ Taking a round table and making it slightly bigger → Not original\n- ✅ Creating a table with a unique asymmetric shape → Original\n\n### The 'Significant Difference' Test\n\nIndian courts apply the **'significant difference'** test:\n\n**Question:** Does the new design have a **significant visual difference** from existing designs?\n\n**Factors Considered:**\n1. **Overall Impression:** How does it look as a whole?\n2. **Distinctive Features:** What makes it stand out?\n3. **Design Freedom:** How much freedom did the designer have?\n4. **Informed User:** What would an informed user notice?\n\n**Example: Two Chair Designs**\n- **Existing Design:** Straight-backed wooden chair\n- **New Design:** Curved-backed wooden chair with unique armrest shape\n- **Analysis:** Significant visual difference in back curve and armrests → Original\n\n### Prior Art Search\n\nBefore filing, you should search for **prior art** (existing designs):\n\n**Where to Search:**\n1. **Indian Design Database:** ipindiaonline.gov.in\n2. **International Databases:** WIPO Global Design Database\n3. **Product Catalogs:** Industry catalogs, websites\n4. **Trade Shows:** Past exhibitions\n5. **Patent Databases:** Some designs are in patent drawings\n\n**Why Search:**\n- Avoid wasting filing fees on designs that can't be registered\n- Identify similar designs to differentiate yours\n- Strengthen your application by showing differences\n\n### Examination Process\n\nWhen you file, the Design Office examines:\n\n**1. Novelty Check:**\n- Searches their database\n- Checks for identical or similar designs\n- Reviews prior publications\n\n**2. Originality Check:**\n- Assesses if design is obvious\n- Compares with similar designs\n- Evaluates visual distinctiveness\n\n**Possible Outcomes:**\n- **Accepted:** Design is novel and original → Registered\n- **Objection:** Examiner finds issues → You must respond\n- **Refused:** Design fails novelty/originality → Rejected\n\n### Common Objections\n\n**Objection 1: Lack of Novelty**\n\"Your design is identical to Design No. XYZ registered in 2015.\"\n\n**Response Strategy:**\n- Show differences between your design and cited design\n- Argue that differences create distinct visual character\n- Provide evidence of unique features\n\n**Objection 2: Lack of Originality**\n\"Your design is an obvious variation of existing designs.\"\n\n**Response Strategy:**\n- Explain the creative choices made\n- Show how combination creates new visual effect\n- Demonstrate significant visual difference\n\n**Objection 3: Functional Features**\n\"The features you claim are purely functional.\"\n\n**Response Strategy:**\n- Distinguish aesthetic features from functional ones\n- Show that aesthetic features are not dictated by function\n- Amend claims to focus on aesthetic aspects\n\n### Best Practices\n\n**1. File Early:**\n- File before any public disclosure\n- Use the 6-month grace period wisely\n- Don't rely on grace period for international filings\n\n**2. Document Development:**\n- Keep records of design development process\n- Date-stamp sketches and prototypes\n- Shows originality and creative process\n\n**3. Conduct Prior Art Search:**\n- Search before investing in development\n- Search before filing\n- Identify design freedom\n\n**4. Focus on Distinctive Features:**\n- Highlight what makes your design unique\n- Emphasize visual differences\n- Show overall distinct character\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 2 Case Study: Philips vs. Remington (Shaver Design)\n\n* **The Design:** Philips' three-headed rotary shaver design\n* **The Challenge:** Remington created a similar three-headed design\n* **Philips' Claim:** Our design is novel and original\n* **Remington's Defense:** Three-headed design is obvious and functional\n* **The Court's Analysis:**\n  - Three heads are functional (better shaving coverage)\n  - But the specific arrangement, shape, and visual appearance are aesthetic\n  - Philips' design has distinct visual character\n  - Not an obvious variation\n* **The Outcome:** Philips' design was upheld as novel and original\n* **The Lesson:** Even if some features are functional, the overall aesthetic arrangement can be original. The key is showing significant visual difference from prior designs.",
