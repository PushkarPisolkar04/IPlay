  "content": "## Legal Protection in India (No Specific Law!)\n\nUnlike Copyright (Copyright Act), Trademark (Trade Marks Act), or Patent (Patents Act), India does **not** have a dedicated Trade Secrets Act.\n\nSo how are trade secrets protected? Through a **patchwork of laws**:\n\n### 1. Contract Law (Indian Contract Act, 1872)\n\n**The Tool:** Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) and Employment Contracts\n\n**How it Works:**\n- Employees sign contracts promising not to disclose confidential information\n- Business partners sign NDAs before sharing secrets\n- If someone breaches the contract, you can sue for **breach of contract**\n\n**Remedies:**\n- **Injunction:** Court order to stop disclosure\n- **Damages:** Monetary compensation for losses\n- **Specific Performance:** Court order to fulfill contract terms\n\n**Example:** If an employee signs an NDA and then leaks your customer list to a competitor, you can sue them for breach of contract.\n\n### 2. Common Law (Breach of Confidence)\n\n**The Principle:** Even without a written contract, the law recognizes a duty of confidence in certain relationships.\n\n**When it Applies:**\n- Employer-employee relationships\n- Doctor-patient relationships\n- Lawyer-client relationships\n- Business partnerships\n\n**The Test (3 Requirements):**\n1. **The information must be confidential** (not public knowledge)\n2. **It was communicated in circumstances of confidence** (the recipient knew or should have known it was confidential)\n3. **There was unauthorized use** of the information\n\n**Example:** Even if an employee never signed an NDA, they still have a duty not to disclose confidential information they learned during employment.\n\n### 3. Information Technology Act, 2000 (Section 43 & 66)\n\n**For Digital Trade Secrets:**\n\n**Section 43:** Penalty for unauthorized access to computer systems\n- If someone hacks into your computer to steal trade secrets\n- Compensation up to ₹1 crore\n\n**Section 66:** Hacking with intent to cause wrongful loss\n- Criminal offense\n- Imprisonment up to 3 years\n- Fine up to ₹5 lakh\n\n**Example:** If a competitor hacks your company's server to steal your source code, they can be prosecuted under the IT Act.\n\n### 4. Indian Penal Code, 1860\n\n**Section 405:** Criminal breach of trust\n- If an employee misappropriates confidential information\n- Imprisonment up to 3 years or fine\n\n**Section 408:** Criminal breach of trust by employee\n- Specific provision for employees\n- Imprisonment up to 7 years and fine\n\n**Example:** If an employee steals your customer database and sells it to a competitor, they can be prosecuted under the IPC.\n\n### 5. Specific Statutes\n\nSome industries have specific laws:\n\n**Competition Act, 2002:**\n- Protects against unfair trade practices\n- Prevents abuse of dominant position\n\n**Companies Act, 2013:**\n- Directors have fiduciary duties\n- Cannot misuse confidential information\n\n### The Proposed Trade Secrets Law\n\n**Status:** India is considering a dedicated Trade Secrets Protection Act\n\n**Why?**\n- Current patchwork is complex and inconsistent\n- International pressure (TRIPS Agreement encourages trade secret protection)\n- Need for clearer remedies and procedures\n\n**What it might include:**\n- Clear definition of trade secrets\n- Specific remedies for misappropriation\n- Criminal penalties\n- Procedures for protecting secrets during litigation\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 2 Case Study: John Richard Brady vs. Chemical Process Equipment (1987)\n\n* **The Facts:** Brady was an employee who had access to confidential technical drawings and processes. After leaving the company, he used this information to help a competitor.\n* **The Legal Issue:** There was no written NDA. Could the company still sue?\n* **The Court's Ruling:** YES. The court held that:\n  - An employee has an implied duty of confidence\n  - This duty continues even after employment ends\n  - The information was clearly confidential\n  - Brady breached this duty by using it for a competitor\n* **The Remedy:** Injunction granted to stop Brady from using the information\n* **The Lesson:** Even without a written contract, Indian courts recognize and enforce duties of confidence. However, having a written NDA makes enforcement much easier.",
