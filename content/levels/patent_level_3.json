  "content": "## What CANNOT be Patented (Global Exceptions)\n\nEven if an idea is 'new', 'inventive', and 'useful', there are certain categories of discoveries that almost all countries agree **cannot be patented**. \n\nThese are often seen as the fundamental tools of human knowledge, which must remain free for everyone to use.\n\n### 1. Abstract Ideas, Laws of Nature, and Natural Phenomena\nThis is the biggest category. You cannot 'own' a fundamental truth about the universe.\n\n* **Laws of Nature:** You cannot patent 'gravity'. You cannot patent **E=mc²**.  These are *discoveries*, not *inventions*.\n* **Natural Phenomena:** You cannot patent a new butterfly you discover in the Amazon. You cannot patent a mineral found in the earth. \n* **Abstract Ideas:** You cannot patent a mental process, a set of rules for a game, or a business method *as an idea*. For example, you can't patent the *idea* of 'holding an auction' or 'teaching a class online'.\n\n**The Rule:** You *can*, however, patent a practical **application** of these things. \n- You can't patent E=mc², but you *can* patent a novel nuclear reactor that *uses* that principle in a new way.\n- You can't patent the *idea* of an online auction, but you *can* patent a specific piece of *software* or a *server architecture* that makes that auction possible in a new, inventive way. \n\n### 2. Mathematical Formulas and Algorithms (as ideas)\nJust like abstract ideas, a pure algorithm (like a sorting algorithm) or a mathematical formula is considered a 'mental act' and cannot be patented by itself. You can patent a physical device (like a computer) that *uses* the algorithm in an inventive way, but not the algorithm in the abstract.\n\n### 3. Methods of Medical Treatment\nMost countries (especially outside the US) do **not** allow patents on **methods for treating humans**. This is for ethical reasons: a doctor's first priority should be to save a life, not to check if their surgical *technique* is patented by someone. \n\n* **What CAN be patented:** You *can* patent the *tools* or *drugs* used in the treatment. For example:\n    * **CANNOT Patent:** 'A method of performing heart surgery'.\n    * **CAN Patent:** A new, inventive 'scalpel' (the tool) or a new 'heart medication' (the drug).\n\n### 4. Literary, Dramatic, or Artistic Works\nThese are explicitly excluded from patent law because they are protected by **Copyright**. You patent inventions; you copyright art.\n\n### 5. Inventions Contrary to Public Order or Morality\nAll patent systems have a 'morality' clause. This is used to refuse patents on inventions that are considered universally unethical, such as a new, more efficient landmine or a device for torture.",
