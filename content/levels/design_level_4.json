  "content": "## Design vs. Copyright (The Artistic Overlap)\n\nOne of the trickiest areas in IP law is the overlap between design and copyright. When does a design become art? When does art become a design?\n\n### The Fundamental Difference\n\n**Copyright:**\n- Protects **original artistic works**\n- Automatic protection (no registration needed)\n- Longer duration (60 years after author's death in India)\n- Protects expression, not ideas\n\n**Design:**\n- Protects **industrial designs** applied to articles\n- Requires registration\n- Shorter duration (10 + 5 years)\n- Protects visual appearance of products\n\n### The 50-Copy Rule (Section 15, Copyright Act)\n\n**The Rule:**\nIf an artistic work is reproduced **more than 50 times** by an industrial process, it loses copyright protection and must be protected as a design.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n**Copies 1-50:**\n- Copyright protection applies\n- No design registration needed\n- Treated as artistic work\n\n**Copies 51+:**\n- Copyright protection ceases\n- Must register as design for protection\n- Treated as industrial product\n\n**Example:**\n- An artist creates a unique chair sculpture\n- Makes 10 copies → Copyright protects it\n- Decides to mass-produce 1000 copies → Must register as design\n\n### Applied Art: The Gray Zone\n\n**What is Applied Art?**\nArtistic works applied to functional objects.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Textile patterns on fabric\n- Decorative motifs on furniture\n- Artistic designs on ceramics\n- Illustrations on product packaging\n\n**The Dilemma:**\n- Is it art (copyright)?\n- Or industrial design (design registration)?\n\n**Indian Approach:**\n- If mass-produced (>50 copies) → Design\n- If limited edition → Copyright\n- If separable from function → May be both\n\n### The Separability Doctrine\n\n**Question:** Can the artistic element be separated from the functional object?\n\n**Physical Separability:**\nCan you physically remove the artistic element?\n\n**Example:**\n- A painting on a vase → Physically separable → Copyright\n- The shape of the vase itself → Not separable → Design\n\n**Conceptual Separability:**\nCan you imagine the artistic element independent of the object?\n\n**Example:**\n- A decorative pattern on a plate → Conceptually separable → Copyright\n- The plate's shape → Not separable → Design\n\n**Result:**\n- Separable elements → Copyright\n- Non-separable elements → Design\n\n### Dual Protection Strategy\n\nSome works can have BOTH copyright and design protection:\n\n**Strategy:**\n1. **Copyright:** Protects the artistic expression\n2. **Design:** Protects the industrial application\n\n**Example: Textile Design**\n- **Copyright:** Protects the original pattern/artwork\n- **Design:** Protects the pattern as applied to fabric\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Broader protection\n- Longer duration (copyright)\n- Stronger enforcement (design)\n\n**Limitations:**\n- 50-copy rule may terminate copyright\n- Must register design separately\n- Different infringement tests\n\n### Famous Cases: Design vs. Copyright\n\n#### Case 1: Microfibres Inc. v. Girdhar & Co. (2009)\n\n**Facts:**\n- Microfibres created fabric designs\n- Claimed both copyright and design protection\n- Girdhar copied the designs\n\n**Issue:** Can fabric designs have both copyright and design protection?\n\n**Court's Ruling:**\n- Artistic works applied to industrial products need design registration\n- Once mass-produced, copyright protection is limited\n- Design registration is the primary protection for industrial designs\n\n**Lesson:** For mass-produced products, design registration is essential.\n\n#### Case 2: Ritika Private Ltd. v. Biba Apparels (2016)\n\n**Facts:**\n- Ritika created artistic fabric designs\n- Registered as designs\n- Biba copied the designs\n\n**Issue:** Does design registration preclude copyright protection?\n\n**Court's Ruling:**\n- Design and copyright can coexist\n- But for industrial products, design is the primary right\n- Copyright may protect the underlying artistic work\n\n**Lesson:** Dual protection is possible, but design is primary for industrial use.\n\n### When to Choose Copyright vs. Design\n\n**Choose Copyright When:**\n- Limited production (<50 copies)\n- Pure artistic work (paintings, sculptures)\n- Want automatic protection\n- Need longer protection period\n- Work is not applied to industrial products\n\n**Choose Design When:**\n- Mass production (>50 copies)\n- Applied to industrial products\n- Want stronger enforcement\n- Need to prevent copying of appearance\n- Product is functional with aesthetic features\n\n**Choose Both When:**\n- Artistic work applied to products\n- Want maximum protection\n- Can separate artistic element from function\n- Budget allows dual registration\n\n### Practical Scenarios\n\n#### Scenario 1: Fashion Designer\n\n**Situation:**\n- Creates unique dress designs\n- Plans to produce 500 units\n\n**Protection Strategy:**\n- Register dress design (shape, cut, appearance)\n- Copyright protects original sketches\n- Trademark for brand name\n\n**Why:**\n- Mass production requires design registration\n- Sketches remain copyright-protected\n- Brand identity needs trademark\n\n#### Scenario 2: Furniture Designer\n\n**Situation:**\n- Creates artistic chair with unique shape\n- Limited edition of 25 pieces\n\n**Protection Strategy:**\n- Rely on copyright (automatic)\n- Consider design registration for future mass production\n- Document creation process\n\n**Why:**\n- Under 50 copies → Copyright sufficient\n- Design registration optional but recommended\n- Keeps options open for future\n\n#### Scenario 3: Textile Designer\n\n**Situation:**\n- Creates original fabric patterns\n- Licenses to manufacturers\n\n**Protection Strategy:**\n- Register design for each pattern\n- Maintain copyright in original artwork\n- License both rights separately\n\n**Why:**\n- Mass production by licensees requires design\n- Original artwork retains copyright\n- Dual protection maximizes value\n\n### The \"Artistic Craftsmanship\" Exception\n\n**Section 2(c), Copyright Act:**\nWorks of \"artistic craftsmanship\" are protected by copyright regardless of reproduction.\n\n**What Qualifies:**\n- Hand-crafted items\n- Unique artistic merit\n- Not purely industrial\n\n**Examples:**\n- Hand-woven carpets with unique designs\n- Artisan pottery with artistic elements\n- Hand-carved furniture\n\n**Test:**\n- Is it primarily artistic or industrial?\n- Does it have aesthetic appeal beyond function?\n- Is it hand-crafted or mass-produced?\n\n**Result:**\n- True artistic craftsmanship → Copyright\n- Industrial production → Design\n\n### International Perspective\n\n**European Union:**\n- No 50-copy rule\n- Copyright and design can coexist\n- \"Cumulation\" of rights allowed\n\n**United States:**\n- \"Separability\" doctrine strictly applied\n- Design patents for industrial designs\n- Copyright for separable artistic elements\n\n**India:**\n- 50-copy rule applies\n- Limited cumulation\n- Design registration preferred for industrial products\n\n### Best Practices\n\n**1. Document Everything:**\n- Keep original sketches and designs\n- Date-stamp creation process\n- Maintain evidence of authorship\n\n**2. Register Early:**\n- Register design before mass production\n- Don't wait until 50 copies are made\n- Copyright is automatic but design needs registration\n\n**3. Separate Artistic Elements:**\n- Identify separable artistic components\n- Protect them separately with copyright\n- Register overall design\n\n**4. Plan Production:**\n- If planning mass production, register design\n- If limited edition, rely on copyright\n- Consider future plans\n\n**5. Use Dual Protection:**\n- Register design for industrial application\n- Maintain copyright in original artwork\n- License both rights\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 4 Case Study: Marimekko Textile Designs\n\n* **The Company:** Marimekko, Finnish design house famous for bold textile patterns\n* **The Challenge:** Protecting fabric designs that are both artistic and industrial\n* **The Strategy:**\n  - Copyright protection for original artwork/patterns\n  - Design registration for patterns applied to fabrics\n  - Trademark for iconic patterns (like \"Unikko\" poppy pattern)\n* **The Result:**\n  - Triple protection: copyright + design + trademark\n  - Original artwork remains copyright-protected\n  - Industrial application protected by design\n  - Iconic patterns become trademarks\n* **The Lesson:** For applied art, use a layered protection strategy. Copyright protects the original creation, design protects the industrial application, and over time, iconic designs can become trademarks. This maximizes protection and commercial value.\n* **Indian Application:** Indian textile designers should follow this model - register designs for mass-produced fabrics while maintaining copyright in original artwork.",
