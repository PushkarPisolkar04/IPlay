  "content": "## Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)\n\nThe **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)** is the most important tool for protecting trade secrets. It's a legal contract where one party agrees not to disclose confidential information shared by another party.\n\n### Types of NDAs\n\n#### 1. Unilateral NDA (One-Way)\n**When:** One party shares secrets with another\n**Example:** \n- Startup pitching to investor\n- Company sharing data with consultant\n- Employer hiring employee\n\n**Structure:** \"Party A will share confidential information with Party B. Party B agrees not to disclose it.\"\n\n#### 2. Bilateral NDA (Two-Way / Mutual)\n**When:** Both parties will share secrets with each other\n**Example:**\n- Two companies exploring a merger\n- Joint venture discussions\n- Technology collaboration\n\n**Structure:** \"Both Party A and Party B will share confidential information. Both agree not to disclose the other's information.\"\n\n#### 3. Multilateral NDA\n**When:** Three or more parties involved\n**Example:** Consortium projects, multi-party collaborations\n\n### Essential Clauses in an NDA\n\n#### 1. Definition of Confidential Information\n**Must be specific:**\n- \"All technical data, customer lists, financial information, business plans...\"\n- Can include: \"Information marked as 'Confidential'\"\n- Can include: \"Information disclosed orally and confirmed in writing within 7 days\"\n\n**What's NOT confidential:**\n- Information already public\n- Information independently developed\n- Information received from a third party without restrictions\n\n#### 2. Obligations of the Receiving Party\n**Must state:**\n- \"Will not disclose to any third party\"\n- \"Will use only for the specified purpose\"\n- \"Will protect with same care as own confidential information\"\n- \"Will limit access to employees who need to know\"\n\n#### 3. Duration\n**How long does the NDA last?**\n- **During the relationship:** While employed, while project continues\n- **After termination:** Usually 2-5 years after relationship ends\n- **Perpetual:** For truly sensitive secrets (like formulas)\n\n**Example:** \"This agreement shall remain in effect for 3 years after termination of employment.\"\n\n#### 4. Permitted Disclosures\n**Exceptions where disclosure is allowed:**\n- Required by law or court order\n- To lawyers or accountants (who are also bound by confidentiality)\n- With prior written consent\n\n#### 5. Return of Information\n**Upon termination:**\n- All documents must be returned\n- All copies must be destroyed\n- Digital files must be deleted\n- Certification of destruction may be required\n\n#### 6. Remedies\n**What happens if NDA is breached?**\n- **Injunction:** Court order to stop disclosure\n- **Damages:** Monetary compensation\n- **Liquidated damages:** Pre-agreed amount (e.g., ₹10 lakh)\n- **Attorney fees:** Breaching party pays legal costs\n\n#### 7. Jurisdiction\n**Which court has authority?**\n- \"Disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in [City], India\"\n- Important for enforcement\n\n### Common Mistakes in NDAs\n\n**1. Too Vague:**\n❌ \"All information shared is confidential\"\n✅ \"Confidential Information includes: technical specifications, customer data, pricing information...\"\n\n**2. Too Broad:**\n❌ \"Employee can never work in this industry again\"\n✅ \"Employee will not disclose customer lists for 2 years\"\n\n**3. No Time Limit:**\n❌ \"This agreement lasts forever\"\n✅ \"This agreement lasts for 3 years after termination\"\n\n**4. No Remedies:**\n❌ No mention of what happens if breached\n✅ \"Breach will result in injunction and damages of ₹5 lakh\"\n\n### Enforceability in India\n\n**Indian courts will enforce NDAs if:**\n1. **Reasonable in scope:** Not overly broad\n2. **Reasonable in duration:** Not perpetual (unless justified)\n3. **Protects legitimate interest:** Actual trade secrets, not general skills\n4. **Not against public policy:** Can't prevent someone from earning a livelihood\n\n**Important:** Non-compete clauses (preventing someone from working for competitors) are generally **not enforceable** in India under Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, UNLESS they're part of a sale of business or partnership dissolution.\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 3 Case Study: Diljeet Titus vs. Alfred A. Adebare (2006)\n\n* **The Facts:** A law firm (Titus) hired a lawyer (Adebare) who signed an NDA. After leaving, Adebare joined a competing firm and allegedly used confidential client information.\n* **The NDA:** Prohibited disclosure of client information for 2 years after leaving.\n* **The Legal Battle:** Titus sued for breach of NDA and sought an injunction.\n* **The Court's Decision:** \n  - The NDA was valid and enforceable\n  - Client information is a legitimate trade secret\n  - 2-year duration was reasonable\n  - Injunction granted to prevent Adebare from using the information\n* **The Lesson:** Well-drafted NDAs with reasonable terms are enforceable in Indian courts. The key is to be specific about what's confidential and have a reasonable time limit.",
