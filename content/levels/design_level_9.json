  "content": "## International Protection (The Hague Agreement)\n\nDesign protection is territorial - an Indian registration only protects in India. To protect globally, you need international strategies.\n\n### The Territorial Nature of Design Rights\n\n**Key Principle:**\nDesign rights are **territorial** - they only apply in the country where registered.\n\n**What This Means:**\n- Indian design registration → Protection only in India\n- US design patent → Protection only in USA\n- EU design → Protection only in EU countries\n\n**Implication:**\nIf you want global protection, you need multiple registrations.\n\n**Example:**\n- You register a chair design in India\n- Competitor copies it in China\n- You cannot stop them (no Chinese registration)\n- Need separate Chinese registration\n\n### International Filing Options\n\n**Option 1: National Filings**\n- File separately in each country\n- Different procedures, languages, fees\n- More control, more expensive\n\n**Option 2: Regional Systems**\n- EU: Community Design (covers all EU countries)\n- ARIPO: African Regional IP Organization\n- Single application, multiple countries\n\n**Option 3: Hague System**\n- International design registration system\n- Single application, multiple countries\n- Administered by WIPO\n- India joined in 2019\n\n### The Hague Agreement\n\n**What is it?**\nAn international treaty that allows design registration in multiple countries through a single application.\n\n**Administered by:**\nWorld Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\n**Member Countries:**\n- 77+ countries (as of 2024)\n- Includes: EU, USA, Japan, South Korea, India, UK, Switzerland, Turkey, etc.\n- Notable absences: China, Brazil, Canada\n\n**India's Membership:**\n- Joined: May 13, 2019\n- Effective: December 13, 2019\n- Major milestone for Indian designers\n\n### How the Hague System Works\n\n**Step 1: File International Application**\n- Single application to WIPO\n- One language (English, French, or Spanish)\n- One set of fees\n- Designate countries for protection\n\n**Step 2: WIPO Examination**\n- Formal examination only\n- Check if application is complete\n- No substantive examination\n- Typically 1-2 months\n\n**Step 3: International Registration**\n- WIPO registers design\n- Publishes in International Designs Bulletin\n- Issues certificate\n\n**Step 4: National Examination**\n- Each designated country examines\n- Apply their national laws\n- Can refuse protection\n- Typically 6-12 months\n\n**Step 5: Protection Granted**\n- If no refusal, protection granted\n- Same effect as national registration\n- Managed centrally through WIPO\n\n### Benefits of Hague System\n\n**1. Single Application**\n- One form, not multiple\n- One language\n- One filing date\n\n**2. Cost Savings**\n- Lower fees than multiple national filings\n- No need for multiple attorneys\n- Centralized management\n\n**3. Simplified Management**\n- Renewals through WIPO\n- Changes (name, address) recorded once\n- Single point of contact\n\n**4. Flexibility**\n- Choose which countries\n- Add countries later (subsequent designation)\n- Manage portfolio easily\n\n**5. Speed**\n- Faster than multiple national filings\n- Streamlined process\n- Quicker protection\n\n### Hague Application Process\n\n#### Eligibility\n\n**Who Can File:**\n- Nationals of Hague member countries\n- Residents of member countries\n- Businesses established in member countries\n\n**Indian Applicants:**\n- Indian nationals can file\n- Residents of India can file\n- Indian companies can file\n\n#### Filing Routes\n\n**Direct Filing:**\n- File directly with WIPO\n- Online through WIPO's e-filing system\n- Most common route\n\n**Indirect Filing:**\n- File through Indian Design Office\n- They forward to WIPO\n- Less common\n\n#### Application Requirements\n\n**1. Applicant Information:**\n- Name and address\n- Nationality\n- Legal status\n\n**2. Design Representations:**\n- Same as national filing\n- Multiple views\n- High quality images\n\n**3. Product Indication:**\n- Description of article\n- Locarno Classification\n\n**4. Designated Countries:**\n- List countries for protection\n- Can add more later\n\n**5. Priority Claim (if applicable):**\n- If claiming priority from earlier filing\n- Within 6 months\n\n#### Fees\n\n**Basic Fee:**\n- CHF 397 (Swiss Francs) for first design\n- CHF 19 for each additional design (up to 100)\n\n**Publication Fee:**\n- CHF 17 per design reproduction\n\n**Designation Fees:**\n- Varies by country\n- Each country sets its own fee\n- Can be substantial\n\n**Example Cost (5 countries):**\n- Basic fee: CHF 397\n- Publication: CHF 119 (7 views)\n- Designation fees: CHF 1,000-3,000 (varies)\n- Total: CHF 1,500-3,500 (~₹1,35,000-₹3,15,000)\n\n**Comparison:**\n- National filings in 5 countries: ₹5,00,000+\n- Hague filing: ₹1,35,000-₹3,15,000\n- Savings: 50-70%\n\n### Priority Rights (Paris Convention)\n\n**What is Priority?**\nThe right to claim the filing date of your first application when filing in other countries.\n\n**How it Works:**\n\n**Day 0:**\n- File design application in India\n- Get filing date: January 1, 2024\n\n**Day 1-180 (6 months):**\n- File in other countries\n- Claim priority from Indian filing\n- Get priority date: January 1, 2024\n\n**Benefit:**\n- Your priority date is January 1, 2024 in all countries\n- Any designs published between January 1 and your filing date don't affect you\n- Protects against intervening publications\n\n**Requirements:**\n- File within 6 months of first filing\n- Provide certified copy of first application\n- Pay priority claim fees\n\n**Example:**\n- January 1: File in India\n- March 1: Competitor publishes similar design\n- June 1: File in USA claiming priority\n- Result: Competitor's March publication doesn't affect you (your priority is January 1)\n\n### National vs. Hague Filing: Comparison\n\n**National Filing:**\n\n**Pros:**\n- More control over each application\n- Can tailor to local requirements\n- Direct relationship with local office\n\n**Cons:**\n- Multiple applications, languages, fees\n- More expensive\n- Complex management\n- Need local attorneys\n\n**Hague Filing:**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Single application\n- Cost savings (50-70%)\n- Centralized management\n- Easier renewals\n\n**Cons:**\n- Limited to member countries (no China, Brazil, Canada)\n- Less control over individual countries\n- Refusals can be harder to overcome\n\n**When to Choose National:**\n- Filing in non-Hague countries (China, Brazil)\n- Need maximum control\n- Complex designs requiring local expertise\n\n**When to Choose Hague:**\n- Filing in multiple Hague countries\n- Want cost savings\n- Prefer simplified management\n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n#### Market-Based Strategy\n\n**Identify Key Markets:**\n- Where will you sell products?\n- Where are competitors located?\n- Where is manufacturing done?\n\n**Prioritize Filings:**\n- File first in most important markets\n- Use priority rights for others\n- Consider budget constraints\n\n**Example:**\n- Indian designer selling furniture globally\n- Key markets: India, USA, EU, Japan\n- Strategy: File in India first, then Hague for USA, EU, Japan\n\n#### Budget-Based Strategy\n\n**Limited Budget:**\n- File in home country first\n- Add key markets gradually\n- Use priority period wisely\n\n**Moderate Budget:**\n- File in home country + 2-3 key markets\n- Use Hague for cost savings\n\n**Large Budget:**\n- File in all major markets\n- Use both Hague and national filings\n- Comprehensive protection\n\n#### Product Lifecycle Strategy\n\n**Short Lifecycle Products:**\n- Fashion, consumer electronics\n- File quickly in key markets\n- May not need full 15-year term\n\n**Long Lifecycle Products:**\n- Furniture, industrial equipment\n- File comprehensively\n- Plan for renewals\n\n### Country-Specific Considerations\n\n#### United States\n\n**Design Patents:**\n- USA calls them \"design patents\", not \"designs\"\n- 15-year term (no renewal)\n- Substantive examination\n- Higher standards than most countries\n\n**Hague in USA:**\n- USA joined Hague in 2015\n- Can file through Hague\n- Same examination as national filing\n\n#### European Union\n\n**Community Design:**\n- Single registration covers all 27 EU countries\n- Unitary right\n- 25-year term (renewable every 5 years)\n\n**Hague in EU:**\n- Can designate EU as single entity\n- Cost-effective for EU-wide protection\n\n#### China\n\n**Not a Hague Member:**\n- Must file nationally in China\n- Separate application required\n- Important market for most products\n\n**Chinese Design System:**\n- Substantive examination\n- 15-year term\n- Relatively fast (6-8 months)\n\n### Enforcement Internationally\n\n**Challenge:**\nEnforcing design rights across borders is difficult.\n\n**Strategies:**\n\n**1. Customs Recordal:**\n- Record design with customs authorities\n- Customs can seize infringing imports\n- Effective in EU, USA, China\n\n**2. Local Litigation:**\n- Sue in each country separately\n- Need local attorneys\n- Expensive but effective\n\n**3. Alternative Dispute Resolution:**\n- Mediation or arbitration\n- WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center\n- Faster and cheaper than litigation\n\n**4. Licensing:**\n- License to local manufacturers\n- They enforce on your behalf\n- Share enforcement costs\n\n### India's Role in International Design Protection\n\n**Before 2019:**\n- Indian designers had to file nationally in each country\n- Expensive and complex\n- Limited international protection\n\n**After 2019 (Hague Membership):**\n- Indian designers can use Hague System\n- Easier and cheaper international protection\n- Boosts Indian design exports\n\n**Impact:**\n- More Indian designs registered internationally\n- Increased protection for Indian designers\n- Encourages design innovation\n\n**Examples:**\n- Indian textile designers protecting patterns globally\n- Indian furniture designers entering international markets\n- Indian product designers competing globally\n\n### Practical Tips\n\n**1. File Early:**\n- File in home country first\n- Use priority period for international filings\n- Don't miss 6-month deadline\n\n**2. Choose Countries Wisely:**\n- Focus on key markets\n- Consider manufacturing locations\n- Balance cost and coverage\n\n**3. Use Hague for Efficiency:**\n- If filing in multiple Hague countries\n- Significant cost savings\n- Easier management\n\n**4. Don't Forget Non-Hague Countries:**\n- China is crucial for most products\n- File nationally where needed\n- Combine Hague and national strategies\n\n**5. Monitor Deadlines:**\n- Priority period: 6 months\n- Renewal deadlines vary by country\n- Use WIPO's centralized renewal for Hague\n\n**6. Budget for Enforcement:**\n- Registration is just the start\n- Need budget for enforcement\n- Consider insurance or legal funds\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 9 Case Study: Dyson's Global Design Strategy\n\n* **The Company:** Dyson, British technology company known for innovative product designs\n* **The Challenge:** Protect distinctive designs (vacuum cleaners, fans, hair dryers) globally\n* **The Strategy:**\n  - File design applications in UK first\n  - Use Hague System for EU, USA, Japan, South Korea, India\n  - File nationally in China (not Hague member)\n  - Comprehensive global coverage (50+ countries)\n* **The Investment:**\n  - Thousands of design registrations\n  - Millions in filing and maintenance fees\n  - Dedicated IP team\n* **The Enforcement:**\n  - Aggressive enforcement against copies\n  - Customs recordal in major markets\n  - Litigation in multiple countries\n  - Seized millions of counterfeit products\n* **The Results:**\n  - Strong design portfolio (3,000+ designs)\n  - Protected market position\n  - Premium pricing maintained\n  - Brand reputation for innovation\n* **The Lesson:** For global products, comprehensive international design protection is essential.
