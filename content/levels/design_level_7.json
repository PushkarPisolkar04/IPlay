Hague Agreement:**\n- Single application for multiple countries\n- Administered by WIPO\n- India is a member (as of 2019)\n\n**2. National Filings:**\n- File separately in each country\n- More expensive\n- More control\n\n**Priority Rights:**\n- 6 months from first filing\n- Can claim priority in other countries\n- Paris Convention\n\n--- \n\n### 💡 Level 7 Case Study: Eames Lounge Chair (Design Rights Management)\n\n* **The Design:** Iconic Eames Lounge Chair (1956) by Charles and Ray Eames\n* **The Rights:**\n  - Originally protected by design registration in multiple countries\n  - Licensed exclusively to Herman Miller (USA) and Vitra (Europe)\n  - Strict quality control and enforcement\n* **The Term:**\n  - Design protection expired after 15 years (around 1971)\n  - Design entered public domain\n  - Anyone could legally copy the design\n* **Post-Expiry Strategy:**\n  - Herman Miller and Vitra continued as authorized manufacturers\n  - Built brand reputation and quality\n  - Trademarked the \"Eames\" name\n  - Marketed as \"authentic\" vs. \"replicas\"\n* **The Market Today:**\n  - Authentic Eames chairs: $5,000-$8,000\n  - Replicas: $500-$1,500\n  - Consumers pay premium for authenticity\n* **The Lesson:** Design protection is limited (15 years), but smart brand management can create lasting value. After design rights expire, focus on trademark protection, brand reputation, and quality to maintain market position. The Eames chair shows that even after design protection ends, strong branding can command premium prices.",
