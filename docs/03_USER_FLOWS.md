- **School:** Only if user's classroom has a schoolId (shows school name)
- **State:** User's state from profile
- **National:** All India

**Type Logic:**
- **All:** Everyone
- **Solo Learners:** Users with classroomIds = []
- **Classroom Learners:** Users with classroomIds ‚â† []

**Period Logic:**
- **Week:** XP earned in last 7 days (requires tracking `xpByDate` in user doc)
- **Month:** Last 30 days
- **All Time:** Total XP

**Note:** Week/Month filters require additional Firestore logic (track daily XP in sub-collection `/users/{uid}/xp_history/{date}` for granularity). For MVP, implement "All Time" only and add Week/Month in Phase 2.

     List<Badge> newBadges = [];
     for (var badge in allBadges) {
       if (!user.badges.contains(badge.id)) {
         if (badge.criteria.type == 'levels_completed' && 
             user.totalLevelsCompleted >= badge.criteria.value) {
           newBadges.add(badge);
         }
         // ... other criteria checks
       }
     }
     return newBadges;
   }
   ```
   
3. If badge earned:
   - Update Firestore:
     ```javascript

**Certificate Flow:**
```
1. User completes final level of a realm (e.g., Copyright Realm Level 6)
   
2. Client detects realm completion:
   ```dart
   if (user.progressSummary['realm_1'].levelsCompleted == 
       user.progressSummary['realm_1'].totalLevels) {
     // Realm complete!
     generateCertificate(userId, 'realm_1');
   }
   ```
   
3. Trigger Cloud Function: generateCertificate()
   ```javascript
   // Firebase Function
   exports.generateCertificate = functions.firestore
     .document('progress/{progressId}')
     .onUpdate(async (change, context) => {
       // Check if realm completed
       // Generate PDF using 'pdf' package
       const pdfBytes = await createCertificatePDF(user, realm);
       
       // Upload to Storage
       const bucket = admin.storage().bucket();
       const filePath = `certificates/${userId}/${realmId}_${timestamp}.pdf`;
       await bucket.file(filePath).save(pdfBytes);
       
       // Create certificate document
       await admin.firestore().collection('certificates').add({
         userId, realmId, certificateUrl: filePath,
         certificateNumber: generateCertNumber(),
         createdAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
       });
     });
   ```
   
4. Client listens for new certificate:
   ```dart
   // Real-time listener
   FirebaseFirestore.instance
     .collection('certificates')
     .where('userId', isEqualTo: currentUser.uid)
     .snapshots()
     .listen((snapshot) {
       if (snapshot.docs.isNotEmpty) {
         showCertificatePopup(snapshot.docs.last);
       }
     });
   ```
   
5. Show certificate popup:

   List<PendingXP> pendingXP = await localDB.query('pending_xp');
   List<PendingProgress> pendingProgress = await localDB.query('pending_progress');
   ```
   
4. For each pending XP:
   ```dart
   for (var pending in pendingXP) {
     try {
       // Update Firestore
       await FirebaseFirestore.instance
         .collection('progress')
         .doc('${pending.userId}__${pending.contentId}')
         .set({
           'xpEarned': FieldValue.increment(pending.xpEarned),
           'completedAt': Timestamp.fromDate(DateTime.parse(pending.timestamp)),
           // ... other fields
         }, SetOptions(merge: true));
       
       // Update user's total XP
       await FirebaseFirestore.instance
         .collection('users')
         .doc(pending.userId)
         .update({
           'totalXP': FieldValue.increment(pending.xpEarned)
         });
       
       // Mark as synced
       await localDB.delete('pending_xp', where: 'id = ?', whereArgs: [pending.id]);
       
     } catch (e) {
       // Sync failed, keep in queue
       print('Sync error: $e');
     }
   }
   ```
   
5. Show notification: "Sync complete! 300 XP added."
   
6. Check for badge unlocks (server-side or client re-check)
   
7. Update UI (refresh leaderboards, badges, etc.)
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- XP: Always additive (use `FieldValue.increment()`)
- Progress: Merge strategy (if level completed offline and online, keep completed)
- Timestamp: Server timestamp wins for "completedAt"

## 7. Edge Cases & Error Handling

### 7.1 Classroom Code Collision

**Scenario:** Two classrooms generated same code (extremely rare with 5-char alphanumeric = 60M combinations)

**Handling:**
```dart
Future<String> generateUniqueClassroomCode() async {
  int attempts = 0;
  while (attempts < 10) {
    String code = generateClassroomCode();
    bool exists = await classroomCodeExists(code);
    if (!exists) return code;
    attempts++;
  }
  throw Exception('Failed to generate unique code after 10 attempts');
}
```

### 7.2 Student Joins Classroom, Then School is Deleted

**Scenario:**
1. Student joins Classroom A (part of School X)
2. Principal deletes School X
3. What happens to Classroom A?

**Handling:**
- School deletion requires all classrooms to be deleted/reassigned first
- If classroom is reassigned to another school ‚Üí Student stays in classroom (new school association)
- If classroom is deleted ‚Üí Cloud Function removes student from classroom but preserves progress

### 7.3 User Deletes Account

**Flow:**
```
1. Profile Screen ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí "Delete Account"
   
2. ‚Üí Delete Account Confirmation
   - Warning: "This will permanently delete your account and all data."
   - Input field: "Type DELETE to confirm"
   - Button: "Delete My Account"
   
3. Trigger Cloud Function: deleteUserAccount()
   ```javascript
   exports.deleteUserAccount = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
     const userId = context.auth.uid;
     
     // 1. Remove from all classrooms
     const user = await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).get();
     for (let classroomId of user.data().classroomIds || []) {
       await admin.firestore().collection('classrooms').doc(classroomId).update({
         studentIds: admin.firestore.FieldValue.arrayRemove(userId)
       });
     }
     
     // 2. If teacher: reassign or delete classrooms
     const classrooms = await admin.firestore().collection('classrooms')
       .where('teacherId', '==', userId).get();
     for (let classroom of classrooms.docs) {
       await classroom.ref.delete(); // Or show prompt to reassign
     }
     
     // 3. If principal: prevent deletion (must transfer first)
     if (user.data().isPrincipal) {
       throw new functions.https.HttpsError(
         'failed-precondition',
         'Transfer school ownership before deleting account'
       );
     }
     
     // 4. Anonymize progress (keep for analytics)
     const progressDocs = await admin.firestore().collection('progress')
       .where('userId', '==', userId).get();
     for (let doc of progressDocs.docs) {
       await doc.ref.update({
         userId: `deleted_user_${Date.now()}`,
         userName: 'Deleted User'
       });
     }
     
     // 5. Delete user document
     await admin.firestore().collection('users').doc(userId).delete();
     
     // 6. Delete Firebase Auth user
     await admin.auth().deleteUser(userId);
     
     // 7. Delete user uploads from Storage
     await deleteUserStorageFiles(userId);
     
     return { success: true };
   });
   ```
   
4. ‚Üí Sign out and redirect to Welcome Screen
```
