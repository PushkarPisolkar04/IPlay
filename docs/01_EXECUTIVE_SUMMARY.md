## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 What is IPlay?

IPlay is a comprehensive educational platform designed to teach Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) concepts through gamification, structured learning paths, and social features. The app supports three user roles (Student, Teacher, Principal) with hierarchical classroom and school management.

**Core Features:**
- üìö **6 Learning Realms** (Copyright, Trademark, Patent, Design, GI, Trade Secrets) with multiple levels each
- üéÆ **7 Mini Games** for interactive learning
- üèÜ **Multi-tier Leaderboards** (Classroom, School, State, National)
- üéì **School & Classroom Management** with unique join codes
- üìä **Progress Tracking** with XP, badges, streaks, certificates
- üì± **Offline Support** for low-bandwidth environments
- üîí **Privacy-First** design with child safety measures

### 1.2 Why This Architecture?

**Free-Tier Sustainability:**
- Firebase Spark plan (‚Çπ0/month) for 1000-5000 users
- Static content hosting (no database reads for content)
- Client-side caching and offline-first design
- Scheduled aggregation to minimize real-time queries

**No AI/ML (Student Project Constraint):**
- Rule-based gamification (XP formulas, badge logic)
- Pre-authored content (no AI generation)
- Simple matching algorithms for daily challenges

**Privacy & Child Safety:**
- No PII beyond email and name
- Optional display names for leaderboards
- Teacher-moderated classrooms only
- No student-to-student messaging
- Terms of Service with parental consent checkbox

**‚ö†Ô∏è UPDATED SIGNUP FLOW:**
- Role selection happens BEFORE account creation
- Students can join classrooms immediately via code
- Teachers can create schools or join existing ones during signup
- Solo learners supported (can join classrooms later, progress preserved)

## 3. User Roles & Capabilities

### 3.1 Student Role

**Primary Functions:**
- Browse and complete learning realms/levels
- Play mini games for additional XP
- Join classrooms using classroom codes
- View leaderboards (filtered by scope)
- Track personal progress (XP, streaks, badges)
- Download content for offline use
- Submit assignments (text + 1 image)
- View classroom announcements
- Generate and download certificates

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot create content
- Cannot message other students
- Cannot see other students' detailed progress (only leaderboard ranks)
- Cannot join more than 10 classrooms

**Data Owned:**
- Personal profile (name, email, avatar, display name)
- Progress records (XP, completed levels, game scores)
- Badges and certificates
- Classroom memberships

### 3.2 Teacher Role

**Primary Functions:**
- Create independent classrooms OR join a school first
- Generate unique classroom codes (7 chars: `CLS-XXXXX`)
- Approve/reject student join requests
- Post classroom announcements
- Create assignments (text, images, PDFs max 5MB)
- Upload teaching materials (PDFs max 5MB, images max 2MB)
- View classroom analytics (student progress, engagement)
- Export classroom data (CSV)
- Create schools (becomes Principal of that school)

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot access other teachers' classrooms (unless invited as co-teacher in Phase 2)
- Cannot ban users (only remove from their classrooms)
- Upload limits: 50MB total per teacher (Spark tier constraint)

**Data Owned:**
- Teacher profile
- Created classrooms (metadata, join codes)
- Announcements
- Assignments and teaching materials
- Student rosters (references to student IDs)

### 3.3 Principal Role

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Principal is NOT a separate role! It's a flag (`isPrincipal: true`)

**How It Works:**
- A Teacher becomes a Principal by creating a school
- This can happen:
  1. **During signup** - If teacher has no school code (first teacher in school)
  2. **After signup** - Via "Create School" button in Teacher Dashboard
- Principal is stored as metadata: `isPrincipal: true` in user document
- One teacher can be Principal of only ONE school at a time
- **Multiple teachers** can be in one school (they join via school code)
- Only the **FIRST teacher** (who created school) is the principal

**Additional Capabilities (beyond Teacher):**
- Create school with unique 8-char code (`SCH-XXXXX`)
- Generate school QR codes and shareable links
- Approve teachers joining the school
- View school-wide analytics (all classrooms from all teachers)
- Reassign classrooms to other teachers
- Transfer school ownership to another teacher (must be in same school)
- Delete school (requires emptying all classrooms first)

**Example Scenario:**
```
Delhi Public School (SCH-DPS01)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Principal: Mr. Sharma (isPrincipal: true) - Created school
  ‚îú‚îÄ Teacher: Mrs. Gupta (isPrincipal: false) - Joined via SCH-DPS01
  ‚îú‚îÄ Teacher: Mr. Verma (isPrincipal: false) - Joined via SCH-DPS01
  ‚îî‚îÄ Teacher: Ms. Reddy (isPrincipal: false) - Joined via SCH-DPS01
```

**Data Owned:**
- School document (name, state, metadata)
- School-level analytics aggregations

### 3.4 Admin Role (Platform Level)

**Access:** Separate web dashboard (not in mobile app)

**Capabilities:**
- View platform-wide analytics:
  - Total users, schools, classrooms, teachers
  - Daily/Monthly active users (DAU/MAU)
  - Content engagement metrics
  - Storage and Firestore usage
- Content moderation:
  - Review reported content (teacher uploads)
  - Delete inappropriate content
  - Warn or ban users
- User management:
  - Force transfer school ownership (emergency)
  - Restore deleted accounts (from backups)
  - Manually approve/reject flagged signups
- System maintenance:
  - Trigger manual backups
  - Update platform content (realms, levels)
  - Manage content versions

**Data Owned:**
- Platform-wide aggregations
- Moderation logs
- System configuration

  // Treat as separate content
} else if (localVersion.minor < serverVersion.minor) {
  showSnackbar("Content improved! Re-download recommended.");
  // Optional update
