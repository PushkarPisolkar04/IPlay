## üìä Cost Analysis (Firebase Spark - Free Tier)

### Current Usage Estimates (1000 active users)
| Resource | Free Limit | Estimated Usage | % Used | Status |
|----------|------------|-----------------|--------|--------|
| **Firestore Storage** | 1 GB | 75 MB | 7.5% | ‚úÖ Safe |
| **Firestore Reads** | 50,000/day | 5,000/day | 10% | ‚úÖ Safe |
| **Firestore Writes** | 20,000/day | 2,000/day | 10% | ‚úÖ Safe |

**Conclusion:** Sustainable on free tier for **1000-2000 users** with monitoring.

### Scaling Options (If Growth Exceeds Free Tier)
1. **Blaze Plan (Pay-As-You-Go):**
   - Set strict budget alerts ($5/month, $10/month)
   - First tier pricing is very low (~$0.06 per GB Firestore read)
   
2. **Optimization:**
   - Aggressive client-side caching (reduce reads)
   - Compress all uploads (reduce storage)
   - Delete old data (90-day retention for announcements)
   
3. **Alternative:**
   - Move static content to GitHub Pages (free, unlimited)
   - Use external storage for teacher uploads (Google Drive links)
